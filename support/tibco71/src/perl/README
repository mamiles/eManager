Configuring TIB/Rendezvous extensions into Perl5
------------------------------------------------
                        *******IMPORTANT!********

If you are a user of perl on a UNIX derived operating system, you will
obtain the best results if thread support is enabled in your perl
interperter.  If thread support is not enabled, then you may have
stability issues under high message rates.

                        *******IMPORTANT!********

1.  If you do not have a perl installation you will need to install perl
    first.


2.  set the environment variable TIBRV_DIR to point to the directory where
    you installed TIB/Rendezvous into.

    UNIX:
    -----
    (sh) $ export TIBRV_DIR=<installation_directory>
    (csh)% setenv TIBRV_DIR <installation_directory>

    Windows:
    --------
    set TIBRV_DIR=<installation_directory>


    Where <installation_directory> is the directory you installed
    TIB/Rendezvous V6 into.

3.  Build and install the perl extension

    If you do not have write permission to the directory where the
    TIB/Rendezvous perl extensions are installed you can copy them to a
    directory where you have write permission.

    cd into the directory where the perl extension is located perform the
    following:

    perl Makefile.PL

    When that is done you can then do:

    make

    and then

    make install

    (On Windows run nmake or GNU make should work as well.)

4.  Running TIB/Rendezvous perl programs.

    Once TIB/Rendezvous enabled perl is installed you can start writing
    perl programs that use TIB/Rendezvous.  There is provided in the src
    directory where TIB/Rendezvous was installed a perl directory that
    contains some simple examples on how to use TIB/Rendezvous from perl.

    You can use the C programming as a reference for creating perl
    programs.

    On some platforms you may need to set environment variables in order
    for the system to find the TIB/Rendezvous shared libraries.  On most
    UNIX based systems this is LD_LIBRARY_PATH ( or SHLIB_PATH on HP-UX ).
