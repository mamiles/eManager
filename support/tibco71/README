                  TIBCO Rendezvous Version 7.1 Release Notes
*******************************************************************************

The TIBCO Rendezvous (TM) group is pleased to announce the release
Rendezvous Version 7.1.  This is a maintenance release of the
Rendezvous software.

Rendezvous now includes a Java configuration tool, and a Java class
library for configuration.  These additions allow programmatic
configuration of daemons in the product suite.  For more information,
see the new book, TIBCO Rendezvous Configuration Tools
(Administration, vol. 2).  Although you can use this API to obtain
state information from daemons, we strongly caution against continuous
polling.

The Rendezvous Relay Agent Daemon (RVRAD) has been rewritten to use
the RV 6 style API objects. This removes the last vestige of the
obsolete Rendezvous Version 5 code from the Rendezvous codebase.


The functional extensions to Rendezvous Version 7.0 include the
following:

RVD
---

    Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) is now supported on the HP
    Tru64 platform.

    A source code wrapper is supplied to allow RVD running on
    Microsoft Windows systems to run at a specified (usually
    higher than normal) priority.

RVRD
----

    RVRD now supports link compression between neighbors.  This
    compression is precludes SSL encryption between neighbors.  That
    is, you cannot use both SSL and link compression simultaneously on
    the same neighbor link.

    RVRD now checks for user misconfigurations of router names and
    local network names, and prevents name collisions when possible.
    If the configuration of new RVRD process instance conflicts with
    existing routers, the new instance has a faulty configuration
    and cannot join the routing network.

    RVRD displays additional statistics in its the HTTP administrative
    interface.  These statistics show link backlog per-neighbor.

RVSD and RVSRD
--------------

    The secure daemons (RVSD and RVRSD) now support the use of
    PKCS #12 binary keys.

libtibrv
--------

    On EBCDIC machines, the RV API now lets you change the code pages
    that are used to convert from ASCII to EBCDIC.

JAVA
----

    Support has been added for 64 bit JNI libraries on the
    HP-UX and Solaris platforms where applicable.  This requires
    Java 1.4 to be installed.

    Optimizations have been made for performance within the
    Java libraries.

RVDS
----

    RVDS (Data Security) programs can now be successfully built
    with the RV 7 libraries.

rvtrace
-------

  - Enhanced rvtrace to account for and monitor wildcard publishers.

  - Enhanced rvtrace to read from one capture file and write to another
    for the purpose of subsetting or filtering a larger capture file.



Defect corrections from earlier releases:

RVD
---

  - Fixed a defect which limited the PGM variant of RVD to only one
    network interface.  The behavior of the PGM variant is now
    identical to that of the TRDP variant.


RVRD
----

  - Fixed a defect which could cause a large number of short
    duration internal timers to fire.  The symptom of this is
    an excessive amount of CPU usage.

  - Fixed a defect in which incoming messages destined for more
    than one local network interface were delivered to only one of
    the interfaces.  In the characteristic symptom, the RVRD
    configuration and logfile indicate correct routing, but
    message data was sent on only one interface, and not sent 
    on the other local network(s).  

  - Fixed a defect which caused cancellation of subscriptions managed
    by a daemon that exits as a result of a POSIX SIGKIL signal.  The
    subscriptions would not fail over to another RVRD for 60 seconds.
    The symptom was a 60-second hiatus of multicast data into the
    affected subnet.

  - Added Netscape specific extensions to the self-generated SSL
    certificates used in HTTPS, preventing the Netscape browser from
    "blanking out" when users selected the `Routers' link.

  - Fixed a defect which caused a restarted RVCM application to miss
    point-to-point confirmations when directly connected to RVRD and
    using a ledger from a previous process instance.

  - Fixed a defect in rewriting internal point-to-point message headers
    when these messages transit routing daemons.  In some
    circumstances, point-to-point (_INBOX based) CM agreements could
    not be made because point-to-point messages took different paths
    through multiple RVRDs.  The symptom appeared in the RVCM
    applications as failure of the CM applications to reach the
    `Agreement' state.


RVRAD
-----

  - Fixed a race condition in which a CM listener's state in its
    RVRAD was prematurely overwritten.  The symptom was a sender
    side delivery failure, even though no `time to live' is applied
    to the message.

  - Fixed a consistency error in the CM sender's RVRAD CM sequencing.
    The symptom was that a message already sent from one RVRAD
    to another would continue to appear present in the sending RVRAD
    to listening side RVRADs.


libtibrv
--------

  - Fixed a defect under which an application sending data at high 
    rates could fail and produce a corefile if an RVD was abruptly
    killed.

  - Fixed defects which caused an error status of "Insufficient
    Memory" where the underlying error was actually a file write
    or access failure, not a memory allocation failure.

  - Fixed a defect which cased a "Memory allocation failed" error
    to be returned when an application set the message subject to
    an invalid subject name containing two successive "." characters.

  - Removed or guarded against concurrent access of operating system
    calls which have been identified as non-re-entrant.  Under
    certain circumstances these could cause indeterminate failures
    in a multi-threaded application on a multi-CPU host.

  - Fixed a defect in which a reply subject was not properly added to a
    message, and no error status was returned when a reply subject name
    was more than 119 characters in length.


libtibrvcm
----------

  - Fixed two defects which appeared to be RVCM defects but were in
    fact RVRD defects (and corrected in RVRD).  For more details, see
    the earlier section on RVRD defects.


libtibrvft
----------

  - Fixed a defect which prevented delivery of the RVFT
    PREPARE_TO_ACTIVATE hint in certain cases.


rvtrace
-------

  - Fixed a defect in which a TRDP retransmission reject packet
    was incorrectly counted as a "Bad" packet.

Perl
----

  - Restored missing function definitions in the Perl module.



*******************************************************************************
                  TIBCO Rendezvous Version 7.0 Release Notes
*******************************************************************************

The TIBCO Rendezvous group is pleased to announce the release of
Rendezvous Version 7.0.

This release incorporates a number of important new functional changes,
including the following:

    RVRD has been enhanced to support  path costing and import subject
    weighting.  Path costing allows an administrator to specify the preferred
    path that data should travel between a source (publisher's) RVRD and a
    sink (subscriber's) RVRD. Import subject weighting provides a mechanism
    for specifying which RVRDs should handle specific subjects.

    RVRD has also been enhanced to provide administrators a mechanism for
    configuring specific neighbor connections for SSL encryption, thus
    providing a secure mechanism for traversal of Rendezvous messages over
    insecure (e.g. public) networks.

    The HTTP administrative interfaces for the daemons have been enhanced to
    provide secure, HTTPS connectivity.  Daemon-side certificates ensure
    that a connection has been made to the expected daemon; the
    username/password client authentication originally implemented in RV6 is
    also carried forward.

    A PGM (Pragmatic General Multicast) implementation of RV based on
    IETF RFC 3208 is now available.  RV/PGM embodies many of the ideas
    pioneered in RV's original transport mechanism but also allows network
    elements (e.g. routers) to assist in protocol execution.  No application
    changes are required use the PGM daemon.  However, only one version of RV
    may be installed on a given machine at a time.   Although TRDP-based
    Rendezvous daemons cannot communicate directly with PGM-based
    Rendezvous daemons, TRDP-based RV 7 routing daemons can communicate
    with PGM-based RV 7 routing daemons to provide bridging capabilities
    between the two protocols.

    Two new communications daemons, RVSD and RVSRD, provide for secure
    connections between client applications and the communications daemons
    using SSL.  SSL encapsulation of client connections provides an
    administratively simpler mechanism for connecting through firewalls than
    was previously available.  Both RVSD and RVSRD  will require direct client
    connections to use SSL. Client authentication via username/password
    or public/private key certificate is provided.  RVSD and RVSRD also
    provides a mechanism for authorizing access to network/service pairs
    as well as to send/receive subjects.

    The API has been enhanced to include support for Virtual Circuits which
    are built on top of the existing transport mechanisms. Virtual Circuits
    provide an exclusive, monitored connection between two endpoints. Support
    has also been added for Direct application to application inboxes which
    do not use the Rendezvous daemon for communication.

    The Rendezvous COM component now supports both the single threaded
    apartment model (STA) and the multiple threaded apartment model (MTA).
    GUI applications will continue to function with the STA model, while the
    MTA model will allow direct access with no synchronization to objects
    created in and accessed from MTA threads.

    An additional Rendezvous COM component (TibrvsdCOM) provides a
    mechanism for development of applications which can connect  to the RVSD
    and RVSRD daemons.


Compatibility with earlier releases:


    When started via the command line, RVD will no longer exit when there
    are no connected clients.  Daemons which are started with the 
-no-permanent
    flag will exit 2 minutes after the last client disconnects.

    RV 7 applications will not be able to autostart pre-RV 6 daemons.

    A library (libtibrv5util) has been introduced to support applications that
    can only process incoming "raw" datatypes (e.g. "raw" opaques or "raw"
    strings) but cannot process incoming RV messages.

    The RV 7 API includes a mechanism which allows the application developer
    to turn on timer-based batching at the individual transport level for
    use in those situations where reduced context switching and/or reducing
    the number of small packets delivered to the network is more important
    than data latency.

    RV 7 now requires use of WINSOCK2 on Microsoft platforms.  Applications
    which are statically linked on Microsoft platforms must explicitly link
    in ws2_32.lib.

    The RV Version 5.3 compatibility libraries are not included in the
    RV 7 distribution.

  - Added new JAVA examples:   UnicodeSend.java, UnicodeListen.java

  - Updated all examples to remove non-threadsafe calls to localtime()


Documentation Changes
---------------------

   The documentation has been fully updated to reflect the new functionality
   provided in RV 7.


Defect corrections from earlier releases:

RVD
---

  - Fixed defect which could cause application disconnect when data backed
    up pending delivery to multiple clients with different subject sets.

  - Fixed defect which would cause receiver to print erroneous "malformed
    unicast packet" or "malformed ack request"  messages under certain
    point-point dataloss conditions.

  - Reduced the amount of time required for the daemon to recover resources
    after the last client on a given service has exited in order to speed
    up recovery times in certain multi-processing environments.

  - Fixed defect which incorrectly reversed the order of certain parameters
    when printing out informative messages on transport creation failure.

  - Increased maximum size of UDP send/receive buffers to 1 MByte on OS
    platforms which support configuration of large send/receive buffers.

  - Modified administrative interface to limit output of Information Alerts
    to the most recent 50 entries to preclude negative impact on daemon
    performance.

  - Modified administrative interface to limit the output of Subscription
    Information to a maximum of 50 subjects to preclude negative impact on
    daemon performance.  An informative message indicating the total number
    of subjects is displayed when there are more than 50 subjects.

  - Fixed OS/390 specific defect which would cause Client Detail page
    of administrative display to incorrectly display "Unknown User"
    when actual User ID was available.

  - Eliminated unnecessary LISTEN.STOP messages generated when the last
    client exits.

  - Enhanced memory caching mechanism to improve performance when allocating
    message memory.

  - Enhanced batching mechanism to support batching of point-point packets.

  - Enhanced client-daemon connection protocol to facilitate connection through
    proxies (e.g. SOCKS).

  - Reduced the amount of network traffic generated when missing packets are
    outside the sending daemon's reliability interval.

  - Fixed defect which would occasionally prevent proper operation of the
    neighbor hypertext link even when actual neighbor connection was valid
    and operational.


  - The -timerBatch flag has been removed.

  - Per HP's recommendation, the daemon will now use the SCHED_RR priority
    rather than the SCHED_RTPRIO priority on the HP-UX platform.

  - Implemented optimization to prevent excessive memory growth under adverse
    network conditions on certain OS platforms where concurrent memory access
    is less efficient.

  - Fixed defect which would incorrectly loop back multicast traffic between
    applications using identical send and receive addresses when both the
    listening and sending applications were run on the same machine.


RVRD
----

  - Optimized update processing mechanism to reduce the impact of processing
    router state updates in environments with a large number of routers or
    a very large number of subscriptions.

  - Fixed defect which could cause message routing loops when hardware failure
    causes multicast traffic to be unidirectional.

  - Fixed defect which could cause protocol message looping when a single 
router
    is repeatedly shut down and restarted.

  - Modified administrative interface to limit output of Information Alerts
    to the most recent 50 entries to preclude negative impact on daemon
    performance.

  - Modified administrative interface to limit the output of Subscription
    Information to a maximum of 50 subjects to preclude negative impact on
    daemon performance.  An informative message indicating the total number
    of subjects is displayed when there are more than 50 subjects.

  - Fixed OS/390 specific defect which would cause Client Detail page
    of administrative display to incorrectly display "Unknown User"
    when actual User ID was available.

  - Corrected last case of spurious "Unexpected Listen Stop" message.


RVA
---

  - Enhanced client-daemon connection protocol to facilitate connection through
    proxies (e.g. SOCKS).


RVTRACE
-------

  - Fixed defect which could cause messages of type  raw opaque to be
    incorrectly reported as bad data.

  - Added informative error message indicating that subject based information
    might be inaccurate if the capture file was created with a snapshot size
    smaller than the full packet size.

  - Added support for capture files larger than 2 GB on those platforms
    which permit it.

  - Replaced use of non-threadsafe call to localtime() with appropriate
    threadsafe equivalent.

JAVA
----

  - The JAVA class files are now built with JAVA 1.3 in order to address
    serialVersionUID compatibility issues which arose when different versions
    of the JAVA compiler were used on different platforms. Exceptions to this
    are the AIX 4.3 and AS/400 platforms, which continue to be built with
    JAVA 1.1.8.


libtibrv
--------


  - Fixed defect which would erroneously cause a field ID collision when using
    extended tibrvMsg_Add* functions with a field name and field identifier.
    Problem manifested itself as a memory leak when merging data in rvcache.

  - Fixed defect which failed to clear field IDs when tibrvMsg_Reset() was
    called.

  - Enhanced memory caching mechanism to improve performance when allocating
    message memory.

  - Implemented workaround for Windows-specific defect which could cause
    initialization failures when multiple threads made simultaneous attempts
    to call tibrv_Open() for the first time.

  - Fixed defect which could cause memory corruption if the last call to
    tibrv_Close() occurs at precisely the same time as tibrvEvent_Create*()
    is called in another thread.

  - Eliminated  free-run when system time is moved forward more than 24 hours
    without restarting RV.

  - Fixed defect which could lead to lost data when continuing to send
    certified messages after a CM send failure occurs because the filesystem
    has run out of space.

  - Fixed defect which could cause a crash when queue limits were reached while
    subscribing to QUEUE.LIMIT_EXCEEDED and DISPATCHER.THREAD_EXITED 
advisories.


libtibrvcm
----------

  - Fixed defect which would prevent explicit confirmation of subsequent
    messages if earlier messages expired before being confirmed.

  - DELIVERY.FAILED advisories now include the message which has been expired
    by the publisher.

  - Added support for ledger files larger than 2 GB on those platforms which
    permit it.

  - Fixed defect which precluded proper processing of messages acknowledged
    by a CM listener when the CM sender was using RVRAD.


libtibrvft
----------

  - Replaced use of non-threadsafe call to localtime() with appropriate
    threadsafe equivalent.

Perl
----

  - Removed references to deprecated 
Tibrv::tibrvTransport_SetSendingWaitLimit()
    and Tibrv::tibrvTransport_GetSendingWaitLimit() functions.

  - Added support for new Virtual Circuit API calls.
