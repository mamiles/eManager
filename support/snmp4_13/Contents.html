<h1>Usage of Westhawk's SNMP stack</h1>

<a name="introduction"> <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
This document describes the delivery of this stack and how the stack 
can be used for SNMPv1, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3. 
The stack supports traps, authentication and privacy. 
As authentication protocols the stack offers MD5 and SHA1. 
</p>
<p>
This document does not explain SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) 
itself. The reader is assumed to have basic knowledge of the protocol. 
If you want to learn more, see the <a href="#reading">Reading</a>
section.
</p>
<p>
The target applications are <em>small</em> applets, for that reason the
stack has remained tiny. We wanted something lighter that we could just
pop in a (Netscape) frame and leave there all day. It has no MIB
(Management Information Base)
browsing capabilities, you have to know the OID (Object Identifier) of what you want to
monitor. There are <em>many</em> other packages that do MIB browsing and
general network management.
</p>

<p>
The Westhawk Java SNMP stack comes with generated (javadoc)
<a href="./javadoc/index.html" target="outside">documentation</a>. 
Check that documentation for the description of all
methods that are not mentioned in this document or for the description
of the method parameters.

<a name="usage"> <h1>The usage</h1>
<p>
The stack can be used in a number of ways:
<ul>
<li>Using the <a href="#beans">beans</a></li>
<li>Using the <a href="#pdus">PDUs</a></li>
<li>Using the <a href="#blocking calls">blocking calls</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="beans"> <h2>Using the beans</h2>
<p>
The package <code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.beans</code> 
contains all the beans in the stack. 
Except for the <code>UsmDiscoveryBean</code> they all (still) relate to
SNMPv1. 
</p>
<p>
The beans form a bridge between the <code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.pdu</code> (and
<code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack</code>) package(s) and any applet 
or application you may want to write.
</p>
<p>
The beans work via the (asynchronous)
<code>java.beans.PropertyChange</code> mechanism. 
If you are using Swing, don't forget to use
<code>javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(java.lang.Runnable)</code> 
if you want to do any screen updates from the
<code>propertyChange</code> method.</li>
</p>
<p>
Our beans gather specific MIB information, i.e. the OID (Object
Identifier) is hard coded. The beans should be easy enough to
understand, and with little effort you can write a bean for your own purpose.
The beans <code>SNMPBean</code> and <code>SNMPRunBean</code>
contain some general information about the beans as well.
The coding <a href="#example">examples</a> will show you how to use the
beans as well.
</p>

<a name="pdus"> <h2>Using the PDUs</h2>
<p>
The package
<code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.pdu</code> contains all the public accessible
PDUs.
All the Pdus (well, except for the <a href="#blocking calls">BlockPdu</a>) 
extend abstract
<code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack.Pdu</code>. 
The PDUs are non blocking and work via the
<code>java.util.Observer/java.util.Observable</code> mechanism. 
</p>
<p>
The idea is that for each class of problem you should subclass the
abstract <code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack.Pdu</code> class. You will have
to implement the <code>protected void new_value(int n, varbind
res)</code> and the <code>protected void tell_them()</code> methods.
As example look at the <code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.pdu.OneIntPdu</code>
class or any other class in that package.
</p>
<p>
In order to use a PDU do the following:
<ol>
<li>Create a <a href="#context">context</a>, giving it the host name and 
port number of your SNMP agent. If this is run in an applet then you can only 
connect back to that server! </li>
<li>Create a PDU, passing it the context; <code>OneGetPdu pdu = new
OneGetPdu(context)</code>. </li>
<li>Add the OIDs you are interested in with 
<code>pdu.add_oid(oid)</code>.  </li>
<li>Add an observer with <code>pdu.addObserver(observer)</code>. The argument is the
object that wishes to be notified when the new value arrives. 
It must implement
<code>java.util.Observer</code>, that is it must have a
<code>public void update(java.util.Observable obs, java.lang.Object obj)</code>
method. This method will get called when the value arrives. 
If you are using Swing, don't forget to use
<code>javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(java.lang.Runnable)</code> 
if you want to do any screen updates.</li>
<li>Call <code>pdu.send()</code>.</li>
<li>Sleep, or do something else. Your <code>update</code> method will get 
called automatically when the data has arrived. Both the context and PDU
objects spawn their own threads, so there is nothing further to do.</li>
</ol>
</p>
Since traps do not get a reply, you can omit adding an
<code>observer</code> (step 4)
and implementing <code>update</code> (the last step) when sending one.
When sending traps with SNMPv3, please read the
section about the
<a href="#authoritative engine">authoritative engine</a>.
<p>
The coding <a href="#example">examples</a> will show you how to use the
PDUs as well.
</p>

<a name="blocking calls"> <h2>Using the blocking calls</h2>
<p>
The class <code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.pdu.BlockPdu</code> is a wrapper
class around the traditional (non blocking) Pdu. It allows the user to
send either a Set request, a Get request, a GetNext request or a GetBulk
request by
specifying the type of request, see the <code>setPduType</code> method. The 
caller has to add the necessary OIDs with the method <code>addOid</code>.
</p>
<p>
As the title suggests, the BlockPdu sends the request and waits for the
response. 
We suggest that you only use this class if you have to;
Because the pdu blocks, you can not do anything else on
that thread while it is waiting for a reply. If that thread is driving a
UI, then the user may see a sluggish interface. 
If you can, use the <a href="#beans">beans</a> or the <a
href="#pdus">PDUs</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are four methods that send the request, wait for the response and
return the variables or variable bindings. They throw the
<code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack.PduException</code> exception:
<ul>
<li>AsnObject getResponseVariable()</li>
<li>AsnObject [ ] getResponseVariables()</li>
<li>varbind getResponseVariableBinding()</li>
<li>varbind [ ] getResponseVariableBindings()</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The OIDs that are added via <code>addOid</code> method for the request
will not be replaced by the OIDs from the response. This means that
every request will result in the same answer and that the GetNext does
not <em>walk</em> the MIB
</p>

<a name="context"> <h1>The context</h1>
<p>
Every Pdu that is created needs a context. The same context can be used for
a number of Pdus. 
</p>

<a name="context SNMPv1"> <h3>the context for SNMPv1</h3>
<p>
For SNMPv1 the context is built out of the following parameters:
<ul>
<li>The name of the host to which the Pdu is sent</li>
<li>The port number on that host</li>
<li>The community name that is used, by default <em>public</em></li>
<li>The type of socket that is used, by default <em>Standard</em> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The <a href="#socket type">next section</a> explains the use of the type of socket.
</p>

<p>
This SNMP stack provides three contexts for SNMPv1:
<ul>
<li>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack.SnmpContext</li>
<li>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack.SnmpContextPool</li>
<li>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack.PassiveSnmpContext</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The <code>SnmpContextPool</code> contains a pool of
<code>SnmpContext</code> and will share any context that it can share.
This results in a reduced number of threads and other resources.
</p>

<p>
The <code>PassiveSnmpContextPool</code> contains the SNMP v1
context that is needed by a Pdu to send a SNMP v1 request in
environments where thread creation is unwanted, see the 
<a href="./uk/co/westhawk/nothread/notes.html">nothread</a>
notes. 
</p>

<a name="context SNMPv2c"> <h3>the context for SNMPv2c</h3>
<p>
The context for SNMPv2c is very similar to the SNMPv1 context. 
It is built out of the following parameters:
<ul>
<li>The name of the host to which the Pdu is sent</li>
<li>The port number on that host</li>
<li>The community name that is used, by default <em>public</em></li>
<li>The type of socket that is used, by default <em>Standard</em> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The <a href="#socket type">next section</a> explains the use of the type of socket.
</p>

<p>
This SNMP stack provides three contexts for SNMPv2c:
<ul>
<li>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack.SnmpContextv2c</li>
<li>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack.SnmpContextv2cPool</li>
<li>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack.PassiveSnmpContextv2c</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The <code>SnmpContextv2cPool</code> contains a pool of
<code>SnmpContextv2c</code> and will share any context that it can share.
This results in a reduced number of threads and other resources.
</p>

<p>
The <code>PassiveSnmpContextv2c</code> contains the SNMP v2c
context that is needed by a Pdu to send a SNMP v2c request in
environments where thread creation is unwanted, see the 
<a href="./uk/co/westhawk/nothread/notes.html">nothread</a>
notes. 
</p>

<a name="context SNMPv3"> <h3>the context for SNMPv3</h3>
<p>
For SNMPv3 the context is built out of the following parameters. 
<ul>
<li>The name of the host to which the Pdu is sent</li>
<li>The port number on that host</li>
<li>The type of socket that is used, by default <em>Standard</em> </li>
<li>The user name of the SNMP principle, by default <em>initial</em></li>
<li>Whether the user wants to use authentication or not, by default
<em>false</em></li>
<li>The user authentication password</li>
<li>The authentication protocol the user wants to use, by default <em>MD5</em></li>
<li>Whether the user wants to use privacy or not, by default
<em>false</em></li>
<li>The user privacy password</li>
<li>The context engine id of the host</li>
<li>The context name of the host, by default the <em>empty</em> string</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This SNMP stack provides two contexts for SNMPv3:
<ul>
<li>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack.SnmpContextv3</li>
<li>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack.SnmpContextv3Pool</li>
</ul>
</p>

</p>
The <code>SnmpContextv3Pool</code> contains a pool of
<code>SnmpContextv3</code> and will share any context that it can share.
This results in a reduced number of threads and other resources.
<p>

<a name="socket type"> <h1>The socket type</h1>
<p>
At the moment two types of sockets can be used:
<ul>
<li>The standard socket, defined by
<code>SnmpContextFace.STANDARD_SOCKET</code></li>
<li>The Netscape socket, defined by
<code>SnmpContextFace.NETSCAPE_SOCKET</code></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
By default the standard socket will be used. The Netscape socket
provides extra functionality for the Netscape capabilities classes. 
</p>

<p>
The caller needs to use the NETSCAPE_SOCKET socket type when this stack
is used in an applet that is running in Netscape 4.X and when the jar
files needs to be signed.
For more documentation on this subject see
<a
href="http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/signedobj/capabilities/index.html"
target="outside">Introduction
to the capabilities classes</a>.
</p>

<a name="authoritative engine"><h1>The authoritative engine</h1>
<p>
When sending traps the stack becomes
an agent, or an <em>authoritative</em> engine as it is called in SNMPv3, rather
than a manager, or a <em>non-authoritative</em> engine as it is called in
SNMPv3.
</p>
<p>
In SNMPv3 the User-Based Security Model (USM) timeliness mechanism 
is different for authoritative and non-authoritative SNMP engines:
<ul>
<li>a non-authoritative engine must remain loosely
synchronised with an authoritative engine</li>
<li>an authoritative engine must maintain it snmpEngineBoots and
snmpEngineTime</li>
</ul>
This distinction does not apply to SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c.
</p>

<p>
Since the stack is not a <em>real</em> agent, it cannot provide all the
USM synchronisation parameters. For that reason the user has to provide
an implementation of the interface 
<code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack.UsmAgent</code>. This interface provides
the stack with the following information of its authoritative engine:
<ul>
<li><code>Engine ID</code> - The authoritative SNMP Engine ID, which (at
least within an administrative domain) uniquely and unambiguously
identifies the SNMP engine</li>
<li><code>Engine Boots</code> - The authoritative SNMP Engine Boots,
which is a count of the number of times the SNMP engine has
re-booted/re-initialized since snmpEngineID was last configured</li> 
<li><code>Engine Time</code> - The authoritative SNMP Engine Time, which is the number of seconds since the snmpEngineBoots counter was last incremented</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="receiving traps"> <h1>Receiving traps</h1>
<p>
There are different ways to receive traps.
Any combination of these ways can be used at the same time:
<ul>
<li>Receive <a href="#all traps">traps for all hosts</a></li>
<li>Receive <a href="#specific host trap">traps from a specific host</a></li>
<li>Receive <a href="#unhandled traps">unhandled traps</a></li>
</ul>
The conventional and default port to listen for traps is <em>162</em>.
Since on UNIX and Linux systems only the <code>root</code> user is allowed to open that
port, you will have to run as <code>root</code> in order to listen for
traps on that port.
</p>

<a name="all traps"> <h3>Receiving traps from all hosts</h3>
<p>
The class <code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack.DefaultTrapContext</code>
forms the base to receiving traps:
<ul>
<li>Get the instance of the class with <code>DefaultTrapContext trapContext
= DefaultTrapContext.getInstance(port, typeSocket)</code></li>
<li>Add a trap listener with
<code>trapContext.addTrapListener(listener)</code>. 
The argument is the
object that wishes to be notified when the traps arrives. 
It must implement
<code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.event.TrapListener</code>, that is it must have a
<code>public void trapReceived(uk.co.westhawk.snmp.event.TrapEvent evt)</code>
method. This method will get called when the trap is received.</li>
</ul>
The <code>DefaultTrapContext</code> fires 
<a href="#undecoded trap event">undecoded</a>
trap events.
</p>

<a name="specific host trap"> <h3>Receiving traps from a specific host</h3>
<p>
To receive traps from a specific host do the following:
<ul>
<li>Create or reuse a <a href="#context">context</a> with the host name and 
parameters of your SNMP agent. The port number will be ignored in this
case.</li>
<li>Add a trap listener with
<code>context.addTrapListener(listener)</code>. 
The argument is the
object that wishes to be notified when the traps arrives. 
It must implement
<code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.event.TrapListener</code>, that is it must have a
<code>public void trapReceived(uk.co.westhawk.snmp.event.TrapEvent evt)</code>
method. This method will get called when the trap is received.</li>
</ul>
The <code>SnmpContext</code> classes fires 
<a href="#decoded trap event">decoded</a> trap events. 
</p>

<a name="unhandled traps"> <h3>Receiving unhandled traps</h3>
<p>
Unhandled traps are traps that are received (see 
<a href="#all traps">traps for all hosts</a>)
but do not match any of the contexts (see
<a href="#specific host trap">traps from a specific host</a>):
<ul>
<li>Get the instance of the class with <code>DefaultTrapContext trapContext
= DefaultTrapContext.getInstance(port, typeSocket)</code></li>
<li>Add a trap listener with
<code>trapContext.addUnhandledTrapListener(listener)</code>. 
The argument is the
object that wishes to be notified when unhandled traps are received. 
It must implement
<code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.event.TrapListener</code>, that is it must have a
<code>public void trapReceived(uk.co.westhawk.snmp.event.TrapEvent evt)</code>
method. This method will get called when the trap is received and
remains unhandled.</li>
</ul>
The <code>DefaultTrapContext</code> fires 
<a href="#undecoded trap event">undecoded</a>
trap events.
</p>

<a name="trap event"> <h1>The trap event</h1>
<p>
There are two types of trap events:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="#decoded trap event">decoded trap event</a> where a trap pdu is passed</li>
<li>The <a href="#undecoded trap event">undecoded trap event</a> where
the raw bytes of the message are passed</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="decoded trap event"> <h3>The decoded trap event</h3>
<p>
Decoded trap events are fired by the <code>SnmpContext</code> classes
when receiving <a href="#specific host trap">traps from a specific host</a>.
In this case the <code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.event.TrapEvent</code> 
will contain one of the two trap PDUs:
<ul>
<li><code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack.TrapPduv1</code> - The Trap PDU for
SNMPv1</li>
<li><code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.stack.TrapPduv2</code> - The Trap PDU for
SNMPv2c and SNMPv3</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="undecoded trap event"> <h3>The undecoded trap event</h3>
<p>
Undecoded trap events are fired by the <code>DefaultTrapContext</code> class
when receiving <a href="#all traps">traps for all hosts</a> and/or
receiving <a href="#unhandled traps">unhandled traps</a>.
In this case the <code>uk.co.westhawk.snmp.event.TrapEvent</code> 
will contain the following:
<ul>
<li><code>version</code> - The SNMP version number of the trap</li>
<li><code>host address</code> - The IP host address of the host where the
trap came from</li>
<li><code>message</code> - The trap in bytes</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
To decode an undecoded trap event, you create a 
<a href="#context">context</a> on the fly and call 
<code>Pdu trapPdu = context.processIncomingTrap(byte[ ] message)</code>.
The context should contain all the parameters needed to decode the
message. For SNMPv3 this is not so obvious.
</p>

<a name="example"> <h1>Coding example</h1>
<p>
The stack contains a lot of examples in the form of 
applications in the package <code>uk.co.westhawk.examplev1</code>. 
The package <code>uk.co.westhawk.examplev2c</code> contains a few examples
for SNMPv2c.
The package <code>uk.co.westhawk.examplev3</code> contains a few examples
for SNMPv3.
These packages show you how to use the PDUs and beans. Note that because
we implemented SNMPv3 before SNMPv2c, there are more examples for the
first one.
</p>
<p>
The scripts to run these examples are explained in the 
<a href="#run">next</a> section. 
If this example is not sufficient, check if the other examples do what you
are looking for.
</p>

<p>
This example requests sysContact with the BlockPdu. The complete example 
can be found in 
<code>uk.co.westhawk.examplev1.OneBlockOperation</code>
<pre>

    try
    {
        context = new SnmpContextPool(host, port, socketType);
        context.setCommunity(comm);

}
</pre>
</p>

<a name="run"> <h1>Running the examples</h1>
<p>
The <code> uk.co.westhawk.examplev1</code>, 
<code> uk.co.westhawk.examplev2c</code> and 
<code> uk.co.westhawk.examplev3</code> 
directories contain scripts
that, after some configuration, will run the applications in
this directory on the commandline:
<ul>
<li><code>runapplication.bat</code> - MSDOS batch script to run an application</li>
<li><code>runapplication.sh</code> - Bourne shell script to run an application</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
To run the scripts on the commandline, the applications have
to use the STANDARD socket type. The SNMP jar file only contains the
actual SNMP stack, i.e. examples are <em>not</em> included and need to
be compiled.
</p>

<p>
There are two scripts that contain the general environment settings:
<ul>
<li><code>setenv.bat</code> - MSDOS batch script with settings </li>
<li><code>setenv.sh</code> - Bourne shell script with settings</li>
</ul>
They contain the following parameters:
<ul>
<li><code>TABLE</code> - The tablelayout zip or jar file, this file comes with the stack</li>
<li><code>SOURCE</code> - The root dir where the application source live</li>
<li><code>SNMPJAR</code> - The snmp jar file. Leave empty (or comment
out) when you use the source under SOURCE. 
SNMPJAR has priority over SOURCE</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You only need to customise the following parameter in the
runapplication.* scripts:
<ul>
<li><code>JAVA_HOME</code> - The root dir where Java lives</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You have to pass the name of the class file as argument to the
application script. You have to omit the package name, like
<code>'uk.co.westhawk.examplev1.'</code>, since 
that is already filled in in the script:
<pre>
C:\&gt; cd &lt;to where the applications live&gt;
C:\&gt; runapplication OneBlockOperation
</pre>
<pre>
% cd &lt;to where the applications live&gt;
% ./runapplication.sh OneBlockOperation
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Most of the applications will accept a properties file as first argument. 
A properties file has the extension <code>.properties</code> and contains 
the initialisation parameters such as the hostname and the port number.
When the argument is missing, the application will look for the 
file <code>&lt;classname&gt;.properties</code> in the current directory.
</p>

<p>
The commands
<pre>
% cd &lt;to where the applications live&gt;
% ./runapplication.sh OneBlockOperation
</pre>
and
<pre>
% cd &lt;to where the applications live&gt;

<a name="reading"> <h1>Reading</h1>
<p>
Our article on Simple Times (issue Dec 2001) explains the 
<a href="http://www.simple-times.org/pub/simple-times/issues/9-1.html#tools">
history and design decisions</a> 
of the stack.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.simpleweb.org/">SimpleWeb</a> provides links and 
information on network management, including software, RFCs and tutorials. 
The focus is on SNMP and Internet management.
</p>

<p>
For more background on SNMP we recommend the following books:
<ul>
<li>The Simple Book by Marshall T. Rose (Prentice Hall, 1994)</li>
<li>SNMP, SNMPv2, SNMPv3 and RMON 1 and 2 
by William Stallings (Addison-Wesley, 1999), 
ISBN 0-201-48534-6
</li>
</ul>
</p>


<a name="3rd party"> <h1>Third party packages</h1>
<p>
All the jar files that are needed for the <em>core</em> stack are
delivered with the stack. A few jar files are used in other packages 
that do not come with the stack: 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xml4j" target="outside">XML
parser</a> for Java from IBM</li>
<li><a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j" target="outside">Xalan XSLT</a> 
from Apache</li>
<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html"
target="outside">Java
Servlets</a> from Sun Microsystems</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/projects/libsmi" target="outside">libsmi</a> is used in the stubs directory. It is available for Linux, Win, Mac.
</p>

<a name="copyright"> 
<h1>Copyright &amp; License</h1>
<p>
The stack is freeware.
The license (see the header of each file) means that you can do whatever you like with it without
cost, except
<ol>
<li>blame us when it does/doesn't work</li>
<li>remove our copyright</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Strictly the license requires that
you acknowledge our code, by mentioning its origin in the documentation of
any product that uses it (in some cases there may be no documentation).
</p>

<p>
There are no commercial license fees, nor do we have any GPL-style
open-source requirements on our stack.
</p>

<p>
If you want software written that uses the stack or modifications to it
to better suit your project, we would be happy to quote you for the work.
</p>

<p>
We also offer commercial support for organisations who want it.
