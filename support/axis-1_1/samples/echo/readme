To run the echo sample, you must do the following:
1.  Set up your CLASSPATH.
2.  Start a server.
3.  Deploy the service.
4.  Run the sample.

1.  Set up your CLASSPATH.
    The CLASSPATH must contain:  an XML parser (ie., Xerces), JUnit
    (www.junit.org), all the jars in the lib directory, and the directory
    containing the samples subdirectory.

2.  Start a  server.
    To run the sample, you will first need to run a server.  To run a very
    simple server you could run, in a separate window:
        java org.apache.axis.transport.http.SimpleAxisServer -p 8080

3.  Deploy the service.
    To deploy the service, run:
        java org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient deploy.wsdd 

4.  Run the sample.
    Finally, to run the client, run:
        java samples.echo.TestClient

InteropTest.wsdl is the WSDL file that was used to create the implementation
template that became InteropTestSoapBindingImpl.java.
