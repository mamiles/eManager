To run the attachments sample, you must do the following:
1.  Set up your CLASSPATH.
2.  Start a server.
3.  Deploy the service.
4.  Run the sample.

1.  Set up your CLASSPATH.
    The CLASSPATH must contain:  an XML parser (ie., Xerces), JUnit
    (www.junit.org), mail and activation jars (ie., Tomcat's mail.jar and
    activation.jar), all the jars in the lib directory, and the directory
    containing the samples subdirectory.

2.  Start a server.
    You must have a server running (ie., Tomcat) with the AXIS samples
    available to it.  For this test, the AXIS SimplAxisServer is not enough.
    See the documentation for your server for details.

3.  Deploy the service.
    To deploy the service, run:
        java org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient attachdeploy.wsdd 

4.  Run the sample.
    Usage:
      java samples.attachments.EchoAttachment [options] file | dir 

    options:
      -d           turn on debugging - more 'd means more info
      -h<HOST>     server host name
      -l<URL>      ie. http://localhost:80/axis/servlet/AxisServlet
      -p<PORT#>    server port number
      -s<SERVLET>  ie. axis/servlet/AxisServlet
      -u<USERID>   user-id
      -w<PASSWD>   password

If you use the authorization and authentication handlers you'll need
to add a couple of files to your Servlet Engine's current dir:

users.lst
 - list of users and passwords

perms.lst
 - list of users and allowable actions per user

The demo sends the file specified as an attachment to the service which in
turn sends the same attachment back. The file sent back is then compared 
  to see if it matches with the original.

If a directory is specified, the same is done except all the files in that 
 directory are sent, received and compared in one call.

Scripts are provided to help with the above.  Specify the above options if the
  host is not "localhost" or the port is not 8080.

deployit    Will deploy the service.
testit      Will test the service.
undeployit  Will undeploy the service.
