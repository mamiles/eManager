/**
* This is my example of a class that writes a list of a service's
* ports to a file named <serviceName>Lst.lst.
*
* Note:  because of a name clash problem, I add the suffix "Lst".
* I hope to remove this in a future version of this example.
*
* Details of the JavaWriter bug:  JavaWriter looks to make sure a
* class doesn't already exist before creating a file, but not all
* files that we generate are .class files!  This works with
* deploy.wsdd and undeploy.wsdd because these files just happen
* to begin with lowercase letters, where Java classes begin with
* uppercase letters.  But this example shows the problem quite
* well.  I would LIKE to call the file <serviceName>.lst, but
* JavaWriter sees that we already have a class called
* <serviceName> and won't let me proceed.
