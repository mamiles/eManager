Here are things you can read to understand and use Axis better. Remember, 
you also have access to all the source if you really want to find out how
things work (or why they don't).

    Web Services with JAX-RPC and Apache Axis.</a><br>
    by Pankaj Kumar. 
    Starting with a 10000 ft. view of Web Services, prior technologies, current and emerging
    standards, it quickly gets into the nitty-gritties of using JAX-RPC and Apache Axis
    for writing and executing programs. Has a nice coverage of different invocation styles -
    generated stubs, dynamic proxy and dynamic invocation interface. A good place to start
    if you are new to Web Services and Axis.

    <a href="http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">
    RFC 2616: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1
    </a><br>
    This is HTTP. You really do need to understand the basics of how this
    works, to work out why your web service doesn't :)

    <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/saaj/index.html">
    SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ)
    </a><br>
    SAAJ enables developers to produce and consume messages conforming to
    the SOAP 1.1 specification and SOAP with Attachments note. 
</li>
<li>
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxrpc/index.html">    
    Java API for XML-Based RPC (JAX-RPC)
    </a><br>
    The public API for Web Services in Java. 
    JAX-RPC enables Java technology developers to develop SOAP based
    interoperable and portable web services. JAX-RPC provides the core API
    for developing and deploying web services on the Java platform.

    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/">
    XML Schema Part 0: Primer
    </a><br>
    The W3C XML Schema, (WXS) is one of the two sets of datatype SOAP
    supports, the other being the SOAP Section 5 datatypes that predate
    WXS. Complicated as it is, it is useful to have a vague understanding
    of this specification.

<li>
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxm/index.html">    
    Java API for XML Messaging (JAXM)
    </a><br>
    JAXM enables applications to send and receive document oriented XML
    messages using a pure Java API. JAXM implements Simple Object Access
    Protocol (SOAP) 1.1 with Attachments messaging so that developers can
    focus on building, sending, receiving, and decomposing messages for
    their applications instead of programming low level XML communications
    routines.

    When Web Services Go Bad

    Steve Loughran tries to scare people.
    A painful demonstration how deployment and system management are

    Using Web Services Effectively.</a><br>
    
    Blissfully ignoring issues such as versioning, robustness and security and 
    all the other details a production Web Service needs, instead pushing EJB as 
    the only way to process requests, this is Sun's guide to 
    using web services in Java. It also assumes Java is at both ends, so manages 
    to skirt round the interop problem.

    Making Web Services that Work</a><br>
    
    A practical but suspiciously code free paper on how to get web
    services into production. As well as coverage of topics such as
    interop, versioning, security, this (57 page) paper looks at the
    deployment problem, advocating a fully automated deployment process
    in which configuration problems are treated as defects for which
    automated test cases and regresssion testing are appropriate.
    Happyaxis.jsp is the canonical example of this. The author, Steve
    Loughran also looks a bit at what the component model of a federated
    web service world would really be like.

Beginning Java Web Services</a></i><br>
Meeraj Kunnumpurath et al, Wrox Press, September 2002.<br>
    An introductory book, with the early chapters focusing on Axis. <br>
    The <a href="http://www.wrox.com/books/sample-chapters/SampleChapter_1861007531.pdf">
    sample chapter</a> shows how to install Axis with Tomcat 4.0: we do not believe
    that their approach is the best. It is easier to drop jaxrpc.jar and
    saaj.jar into the CATALINA_HOME/common/lib dir than it is to add all
    axis jars to the classpath by hand. The book is based on Axis Beta-3.

    <i>Java development with Ant</i> 
    </a><br>
    by Erik Hatcher and Steve Loughran, Manning Press, July 2002. <br>
    A book on Ant development which covers Web Service development with Axis, 
    along with other topics relevant to Java developers using Ant. The Web Service
    chapter, <A href="http://www.manning.com/hatcher/chap15.pdf">
    chapter 15</A>, is free to download, and was the birthplace of 
    happyaxis.jar. <br>
    The book is based on Axis Beta-2; the web site contains updated
    documentation where appropriate.

<i>AXIS: Next Generation Java SOAP</i><br>
</A>
    by Romin Irani and S Jeelani Bashna, Wrox Press, May 2002.<br> 
    The first nothing-but-Axis book.<br>
    It is based on Beta-1. This is a reasonable book, despite is apparent thinness and
    relative age. If it has a major weakness it believes everything works as intended, 
    which regular Axis users will know is not quite true yet. Maybe they didn't want
    to fault missing features and other gotchas, assuming they would be fixed by the time
    the product shipped, but the effective result is that you can get into minor trouble working
    from this book, trying to use bits that aren't there, or just don't work (yet).

    Covering very early versions of Axis

    the quality of the Axis coverage is high. Good explanations of SOAP, UDDI, and the like.
