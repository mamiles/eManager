======================================================================
Product Name	: TIBCO Hawk(tm)
Release Version	: 4.1.1
Release Date	: May 2003
======================================================================

* Introduction
	TIBCO Hawk is used as a tool for monitoring and managing 
	distributed applications and operating systems. The software 
	is designed specifically for monitoring distributed systems, 
	so there is no centralized console or frequent polling across
	the network. With this structure, TIBCO Hawk software is 
	able to scale to multi-thousand node global networks without
	the use of hierarchical managers and has the flexibility to
	allow individual managed entities to be added or modified
	without the need to re-configure or re-start any other parts
	of the system.

	Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 6 (build 1381)
